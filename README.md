Wiky: A Bidirectional Markup Converter
======================================

Wiky is a [CommonJS] port of same named clientside [Wiki] markup to HTML
converter library written in javascript. As it is bidirectional, it can
convert [Wiki] markup to [HTML] and later convert that generated [HTML] text
back to [Wiki] markup. Optionally [Wiky] will create math formulas from a
simple notation similar to LaTeX.

Wiky is neither an editor nor a widget, though it might be used by these. It
is just a converter.

You can play with it in the [WikyBox]
